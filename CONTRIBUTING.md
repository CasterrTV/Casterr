# Contributing

If you want to contribute, please make sure you follow these guidelines:

## Issues

- Try not to open duplicate issues
- Apply a relevant label to your issue
- If the issue is a bug, please give an explanation of how to reproduce it

## Pull requests

- Include the number of the issue that the pull request is referring to
- Name your commits clearly (Bad commit message: 'Update File' or 'Fixed a boog')
- Try to keep pull requests small and related to only one issue if possible
- Comment your code so that it can be better understood by everyone
- If you are making visual changes, add screenshots

Do (not) have fun!

# Contributing

If you're stumped, you can look at a related [project](https://github.com/orgs/CasterrTV/projects) to find something to do.

We have some general guidelines that you should try to follow as much as possible:

## Issues

- Try not to open duplicate issues
- Apply a relevant label to your issue
- Follow the issue template

## Pull requests

- Include a reference of the issue that the pull request is referring to
- Name your commits clearly (Bad commit message: 'Update File' or 'Fixed a boog')
- Try to keep pull requests small and related to only one issue if possible
- Comment your code so that it can be better understood by everyone
- If you are making visual changes, add screenshots

Do (not) have fun!

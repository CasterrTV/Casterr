## Main Goal

Easing the process of sharing your best moments in-game.

Automatically start recording your game when it is opened. When the game closes, stop recording. Show local recordings and allow users to clip the parts in the video that they want to upload or keep. If the user chooses to upload the video, process it and then send it to an upload service that the user has predefined. Once uploaded give the user the share link.

# Casterr

An open-source project with the goal of making it easy to record your games and share clips when you are done.

## Main Goal

Automatically start recording your game when it is opened. When the game closes, stop recording. Show local recordings and allow users to clip the parts in the video that they want to upload, if the user chooses to upload the video, process and then send it to the server to be stored and give the user back a link to share it.
